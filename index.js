//! How to Use Variables
/* 
    - Helps us reference, change, and/or detail other variables within our data. 
    - Helps shape functions, expressions, operators, and statements.
*/

//! Booleans
/* 
    - True / False 
*/

//! Null
/* 
    - An empty value.
*/

//! Undefined
/* 
    - no value
*/

//! Null vs Undefined
/* 
    - Null is a container with nothing.
    - Undefined is a variable never set.
*/

//! Numbers
/* 
    - Literal numbers; however, there are some minor considerations when handling numbers.
    - Numbers will be rounded at 16 digits
    - Consider the MDN docs (resource link in ReadMe.md) for a deeper dive.
*/

//! String
/* 
    - Represents text.
    - Wrapped in single or double quotes
        Single-Quotes:  'text'
        Double-quotes:  "text"
        Back-tic:       `text`
*/

//! Object
/* 
    - Denoted with curly-brackets { }
    - Stores many values by means of a key/value association
    - A container that can hold multiple datatypes.

    {
        key: value
    }
*/

//! Array
/* 
    - A container that holds a list of items.

    ex:
    let list = [ 'item1', 'item2', 'item3' ];
        (1)   (2)         (3)
    
    1. name of the array.
    2. Denoted with square brackets.
    3. Each item, regardless of datatype, is separated by commas.

    - Is considered a type of object.
        - arrays are also containers that hold multiple datatypes.
*/

//! Data Type Literals
/*  
    - Literal representation of a fixed value when created.
*/

//! Special Values
/* 
    - NaN: Not a Number
    - Infinity
*/
